Hi there! I'm Carol. I'm a DBA and I've been working on IT for less than 2 years. I like to explore new things related to Oracle databases, IAC and Linux overall, aswell as subjects related to Data Engineer.

I started this blog to motivate myself to study, and also to share knowledge! Hope you enjoy :):)
